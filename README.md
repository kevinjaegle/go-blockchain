# Go Blockchain – Learning Project

This repository contains a minimal blockchain prototype written in Go.
The goal of this project is to understand how blockchains work internally:
blocks, hashes, and chaining.

## Features
- Genesis block
- SHA-256 hashing
- Linked blocks (previous hash)

## Run
```bash
go run .

## Example Output
Prev. hash:
Data: Genesis Block
Hash: ...

Prev. hash: ...
Data: Send 1 BTC to Ivan
Hash: ...
